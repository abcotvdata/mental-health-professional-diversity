# Mental health professional diversity

This data shows racial and gender demographics of select categories of mental health professionals according to the Census Bureau's Equal Employment Opportunity Tabulation.

There are two data sheets, one with the data split up by counites and the other by CBSA's (core based statistical areas, or metro areas).

The occupations included are: 
- Total, all occupations                                                       
- Psychologists                                                                
- Counselors, social workers, and other community and social service specialists
- Other therapists

In general, the trend in many areas seems to be that psychologists are overwhelmingly white. Counselors, social workers, and other community and social service specialists seem to be more representative of the workforce. Other therapists are somewhere in the middle.
